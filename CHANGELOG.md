# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Built-in MCP server** - `dexter mcp` serves the index to AI agents over the Model Context Protocol (stdio, or streamable HTTP with `--listen`), modeled on `gopls mcp`. Ten tools cover workspace overview, fuzzy symbol search, definitions with docs and specs, references (including use-chain injected call sites), module API summaries, file outlines, behaviour/protocol implementations, call hierarchy, incremental reindexing, and workspace-wide rename returned as a unified diff for the agent to apply. A running LSP can expose the same tools from its live session via `dexter lsp --mcp-listen=ADDR`, and `dexter mcp --instructions` prints an agent-facing usage guide

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Structural completion snippets** — completions now include snippets for common Elixir forms such as `do`, `defmodule`, `def`, `defp`, `defmacro`, `defstruct`, `defprotocol`, `defimpl`, `defdelegate`, guards, `if`, `case`, `with`, `try`, and ExUnit-style macros; snippet-aware clients also avoid duplicate special-form completions when the same names are imported through `use`. This is an improvement and also fixes some VS Code usability issues do to how VS Code handles completions. Thanks @superhawk610.

### Fixed

- **Index WAL growing unchecked** — SQLite WAL files are capped and checkpointed after reindexing, preventing `.dexter/dexter.db-wal` from growing endlessly. Thanks @flowerett.
- **Top-level script variables** — variables in `.exs` files such as `config/runtime.exs` can now be renamed and highlighted without leaking into nested module or function scopes
- **Document symbols** — local assignments and ordinary function calls no longer appear in the outline, while split-line ExUnit-style macro heads are still shown correctly. Thanks @cjbottaro.
- **Alias-aware import/use/require references** — short aliases in `import`, `use`, and `require` statements now resolve to the full module for references and rename edits
- **Formatter improvements and fixes** — the persistent formatter server now starts Mix's supervisor tree so plugins can call Mix APIs like `Mix.Project.config/0`, and Dexter passes all `.formatter.exs` options through to formatter plugins so plugin-specific settings such as HEEX options are honored. Thanks @superhawk610 and @ogomezba.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Erlang go-to-definition and hover docs** — `textDocument/definition` and `textDocument/hover` now resolve Erlang modules and functions (e.g. `:lists.map/2`), jumping to the `.erl` source and rendering EDoc-style documentation alongside the existing Elixir support (#50)
- **Claude Code plugin and marketplace** — the repo is now a Claude Code marketplace, so Dexter can be installed as an Elixir LSP with `claude plugin marketplace add remoteoss/dexter` followed by `claude plugin install dexter-lsp@dexter`; the plugin wires up `dexter lsp` for `.ex`, `.exs`, and `.heex` files and exposes `followDelegates` and `debug` as configurable options (#59)
- **Lazy document loading for headless LSP clients** — the document store now falls back to reading files from disk for clients that don't drive the full `didOpen`/`didChange`/`didClose` lifecycle (e.g. Claude Code), so definitions, hovers, references, completions, and the other read-only handlers all work without an editor buffer; disk-loaded entries are tracked in an LRU cache (default cap 50, configurable via the new `maxTransientDocuments` init option) and never evict editor-owned buffers (#62)
- **Bracket-pair folding** — `textDocument/foldingRange` now emits ranges for multi-line maps/structs (`{...}`), lists (`[...]`), parenthesized expressions (`(...)`), and binaries (`<<...>>`), in addition to the existing `do/fn..end` and heredoc support; brackets inside strings, comments, sigils, char literals, and atoms are skipped automatically (#56)

### Changed

- **Single consolidated BEAM server** — the per-`.formatter.exs` formatter process was reworked into a hardened persistent BEAM server (`beam_server.exs`) with synchronized stderr capture, automatic restart when `.formatter.exs` changes outside `DidSave`, and invalidation on formatter watcher events (#50, #55)
- **Cached tokenized documents** — tokenized Elixir documents are now reused across LSP handlers instead of being re-tokenized for completions, alias/import/use resolution, buffer-function lookups, and alias-block checks; completion context detection is token-aware so completions correctly ignore strings, comments, and heredocs while still handling Erlang atom modules and dotted prefixes (#50)
- **CI lints the entire codebase** — linting now runs over the whole codebase on every pipeline rather than only the diffed files, so latent issues are caught going forward (#64)

### Fixed

- **Sigil formatting** — the persistent formatter now wires plugin-advertised sigils into `Code.format_string!/2`, so `~H` and other plugin sigils (e.g. `Phoenix.LiveView.HTMLFormatter`) are formatted inside `.ex`/`.exs` files; whole-file plugin formatting stays scoped to plugins that match the file extension (#55)
- **Umbrella formatter config resolution** — child apps without their own `.formatter.exs` now search up to the LSP project root and use the umbrella root config (#50, closes #35, #34)
- **Alias merging for unopened files** — alias merging previously returned `nil` for any file the editor hadn't explicitly opened, breaking `lookupThroughUse`/`lookupThroughUseOf` for headless clients; these now resolve via the lazy document store (#62)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Tokenizer-based parser** — replaced the regex-over-joined-lines parser with a single-pass tokenizer and token walker; geomean throughput on real `.ex` files improved from 84 MB/s to 231 MB/s (#22). But most importantly, this change fixes a ton of edge-case bugs in parsing due to improved consistency.
- **Homebrew tap support** — Dexter can now be installed via `brew install remoteoss/tap/dexter`; the release workflow automatically updates the formula on each tagged release (#14)

### Changed

- **Index database moved to `.dexter/` folder** — the SQLite index now lives at `<project>/.dexter/dexter.db` instead of `<project>/.dexter.db`; existing databases are migrated automatically on next startup (legacy files are deleted and a fresh index is built); update your `.gitignore` to include `.dexter/` instead of `.dexter.db` (#46)
- **Removed periodic reindexing** — eliminated the 30-second full-project reindex that caused CPU spikes (~25%) and unnecessary file I/O; the index now stays current via editor file-watcher events and startup scans (#16)

### Fixed

The tokenizer change in #22 fixed a ton of edge-case bugs. Here are some of them:

- **Heredoc comment misparse** — `#` inside heredoc markdown links was misread as a comment, which cascaded into line merges that swallowed entire `defmacro __using__` bodies and broke use-chain resolution in some modules (#22)
- **Multi-line bracket expressions** — missed references and incorrect line numbers when expressions spanned multiple lines (#22)
- **`require` alias registration** — `require Module, as: Name` now registers aliases for go-to-definition (#22)
- **Multi-hop `defdelegate` chains** — chains like A → B → C now resolve to the final target instead of stopping at the intermediate delegate (recursive up to depth 5) (#22)
- **Multi-line alias blocks** — `alias Parent.{ Child, Other }` blocks now resolve correctly in go-to-definition, hover, references, and completion (#22)
- **Multi-line `use` opts** — `use Module, opts` spanning multiple lines now parses the opts correctly (#22)

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Open-source release** — Dexter is now available under the MIT license on GitHub, with updated install scripts for mise and asdf

### Fixed

- **Aliases injected via `use`** — `use` macros that inject `alias` declarations (e.g. `alias MyApp.Repo` inside `__using__`) now propagate those aliases to the consumer module, so go-to-definition, hover, completions, references, rename, signature help, and all other LSP features correctly resolve the aliased modules; also follows transitive `use` chains and helper `quote do` blocks
- **Module depth tracking** — module nesting depth is now tracked by counting `do..end` and `fn..end` blocks instead of relying on indentation, fixing incorrect module scope attribution when anonymous functions or other nested blocks were present; heredoc content and string literals are now properly excluded from block detection
- **Formatter `_build` lookup in umbrella apps** — the persistent formatter process now walks up from the app's mix root to the umbrella root to find `_build` and `deps`, so formatter plugins and `import_deps` resolve correctly in umbrella projects
- **Folding ranges** — folding range detection now strips strings and comments before checking for block boundaries, preventing false ranges from string content like `"foo do"`

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Completion snippets with parameter names** — function completions now insert tab-stop snippets with real parameter names extracted from the definition during indexing (e.g. `fun(user, opts)` instead of `fun(arg1, arg2)`); falls back to positional names for complex patterns like destructured maps

### Fixed

- **Completion with pipes** — pipe context (`|>`) detection omits the first argument from the snippet since it is already supplied by the pipe
- **Elixir/OTP version mismatch** — stdlib resolution now calls `mise where elixir` / `asdf where elixir` with the project root, so Dexter picks up the version pinned in `.tool-versions` / `mise.toml` rather than the globally latest install; eliminates the "requires a more recent Erlang/OTP" crash when a project pins an Elixir build that targets a specific OTP; a one-time editor error notification is shown if the mismatch is still detected at runtime

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- **Formatter `import_deps` resolution** — the persistent formatter now resolves `import_deps` from `.formatter.exs`, reading each dependency's exported `locals_without_parens` so formatting matches `mix format` output
- **Formatter binary protocol corruption** — the Erlang IO server's default Unicode encoding was expanding bytes > 127 in the binary protocol framing to multi-byte UTF-8, silently corrupting formatted file content on the first format request if the server wasn't yet ready; fixed by forcing raw byte mode on stdin/stdout

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Go-to-references** — `textDocument/references` returns all usages of a module or function across the project, including calls through `__using__`/`import` chains and bare intra-module calls; also finds all bindings and uses of a local variable within its scope
- **Rename** — `textDocument/rename` + `textDocument/prepareRename` rename modules, functions, and variables project-wide; a module rename also renames all submodules (if needed), updates every alias/call/import/use site, and moves the file to its conventional path
- **Near-instant format on save** — `textDocument/formatting` formats the current file on save using the nearest `.formatter.exs`, with full support for formatter plugins like [Styler](https://github.com/remoteoss/elixir-styler); format errors are shown as LSP diagnostics so they appear inline. A persistent BEAM process is kept alive per `.formatter.exs`, eliminating VM startup cost so formatting is near-instant; falls back to `mix format` if the persistent process is unavailable
- **Full workspace symbol search** — `workspace/symbol` fuzzy-searches all indexed symbols by name across the whole project (Cmd-T in VS Code)
- **Go-to-declaration** — `textDocument/declaration` jumps to the `@callback` (or `@macrocallback`) definition for any `@impl`-annotated function; walks `@behaviour` declarations and `use`-chains (including dynamic `use unquote(mod)` patterns resolved via keyword opts) to find the right behaviour module, with a global index fallback for `@impl true`
- **Go-to-implementation** — `textDocument/implementation` jumps from a `@callback` definition to every module that implements it via `@behaviour` or `use`
- **Document symbols** — `textDocument/documentSymbol` returns a fully hierarchical outline of modules, submodules, functions, macros, types, structs, and protocols in the current file
- **Signature help** — `textDocument/signatureHelp` shows function parameter hints (triggered on `(` and `,`), including which argument is active and parameter names extracted from the definition
- **Type definition** — `textDocument/typeDefinition` jumps to the `@type` / `@opaque` declaration for the type under the cursor
- **Folding ranges** — `textDocument/foldingRange` reports foldable regions for `do...end` blocks and heredocs
- **Call hierarchy** — `textDocument/prepareCallHierarchy`, `callHierarchy/incomingCalls`, and `callHierarchy/outgoingCalls` show callers and callees of any function
- **Code actions** — `textDocument/codeAction` offers an "Add alias" quick fix for any unaliased module reference; searches the index when the full module name isn't used, and suggests up to five candidates
- **Document highlight** — `textDocument/documentHighlight` highlights all occurrences of the symbol under the cursor; uses scope-aware tree-sitter variable tracking for local variables, and falls back to token matching for module/function names

### Changed

- **Arity-aware completions** — function completions now emit one entry per callable arity (accounting for default parameters too), so `fun/2` and `fun/3` appear as distinct items
- **Cold indexing performance** — initial indexing is significantly more optimized; `dexter init --profile` added for detailed profiling during startup
- **Go-to-definition and references via use-chain with opts** — dynamic `import unquote(mod)` expressions inside `__using__/1` blocks are now resolved using the keyword opts passed at the `use` call site (e.g. `use MyLib, mod: Mox`)

### Fixed

- **Go-to-definition for nested modules** — a `defmodule Inner do` inside `defmodule Outer do` now creates an implicit alias `Inner → Outer.Inner` within `Outer`'s scope, so qualified calls like `Inner.fun()` resolve correctly
- **Incomplete submodule completions** — submodule segments were missing from completions on large codebases because the raw module row cap was hit before client-side deduplication into immediate segments; the query now uses `SELECT DISTINCT` on segments so the cap applies after dedup
- **Function lookup ordering** — when a name is shared by both a function and a type, the function definition is now returned first

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Hover documentation** — hovering over a module or function now displays its `@moduledoc`/`@doc` content, rendered as Markdown
- **Autocompletion** — module and function completions with documentation shown inline, including support for already-aliased modules and local functions
- **Elixir standard library support** — hover docs and completions now cover Elixir stdlib modules (e.g. `Enum`, `Map`, `String`) and `@typedoc` content
- **`use` macro support** — go-to-definition and hover now work on `use` statements, including complex multi-part module names like `Remote.Oban.Pro.Worker`
- **`__MODULE__` support** — go-to-definition and hover resolve `__MODULE__` references correctly
- **Zed editor support** — added configuration instructions for Zed

### Changed

- **File watching** — the LSP server now watches for external file changes (e.g. branch switches, `git pull`) and automatically refreshes the index, beyond the existing Git HEAD polling
- **Full reindex on version bumps** — when a new version of Dexter requires schema changes, the index is rebuilt entirely on startup instead of attempting an incremental update
- **CI pipeline** — added GitHub Actions CI with linting and tests

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-31

### Changed

- CLI commands (`init`, `reindex`, `lookup`, `lsp`) are now implemented with [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), improving help output and flag handling
- Version string moved to `internal/version/version.go` as a single source of truth; `make release VERSION=x.y.z` now updates that file instead of `server.go`

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- `defdelegate` lookahead now stops at new statement boundaries, preventing `as:` from a nearby defdelegate being incorrectly captured for an unrelated one
- `defmacro` and other definitions after deeply nested modules are now correctly attributed to the outer module — depth tracking via `do...end` block counting replaces the naive bare-`end` pop heuristic
- Relative nested `defmodule` names (e.g. `defmodule PayslipDownloadResponse do` inside `defmodule MyAppWeb.ApiDocs.Payslips do`) are now indexed as the fully-qualified `MyAppWeb.ApiDocs.Payslips.PayslipDownloadResponse`

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- `dexter init` now defaults to current working directory when no path is given
- `dexter init --force` no longer misinterprets `--force` as a path argument
- `dexter init --force` now removes stale WAL files (`.dexter.db-shm`, `.dexter.db-wal`) that could corrupt the new database

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Resolve `__MODULE__` aliases in the LSP buffer context — `alias __MODULE__.Schemas.UserRelationship` now correctly resolves when jumping to definition from an open buffer
- Partial alias resolution in the LSP Definition handler — `Services.AssociateWithTeamV2` now resolves through a `Services` alias to the full module name
- Relative nested `defmodule` — `defmodule PayslipDownloadResponse do` inside `defmodule MyAppWeb.ApiDocs.Payslips do` is now indexed as `MyAppWeb.ApiDocs.Payslips.PayslipDownloadResponse`

### Added

- Go-to-definition for module attributes — pressing the binding on `@endpoint_scopes` jumps to its definition in the current buffer. Reserved Elixir attributes (`@doc`, `@spec`, `@behaviour`, `@callback`, `@impl`, `@derive`, etc.) are excluded.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Resolve `__MODULE__` in alias declarations (e.g. `alias __MODULE__.Services`) so `defdelegate` targets that reference these aliases are correctly followed
- Resolve `__MODULE__` directly in `defdelegate to:` fields (e.g. `to: __MODULE__`)
- Resolve `alias __MODULE__, as: Name` so aliased self-references work in delegate chains
- Resolve partial aliases in `defdelegate to:` (e.g. `to: Services.Foo` where `Services` is an aliased module)

### Changed

- LSP server now auto-builds the index on first startup if no `.dexter.db` exists — no need to run `dexter init` manually
- Project root detection now prefers `.git` over `mix.exs` to correctly locate monorepo roots
- `dexter.followDelegates` LSP initialization option (default: `true`) allows clients to opt out of delegate following

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-30
